As the sun breaks above the ground  
An old man stands on the hill  
As the ground warms to the first rays of light  
A birdsong shatters the still  

His eyes are ablaze  
See the madman in his gaze  

Fly on your way like an eagle  
Fly as high as the sun  
On your wings like an eagle  
Fly and touch the sun  

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears  
Look the old man in his eyes  
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd  
In the name of God my father I fly  

His eyes seem so glazed  
As he flies on the wings of a dream  
Now he knows his father betrayed  
Now his wings burn to ashes to ashes his grave  

Fly on your way like an eagle  
Fly as high as the sun  
On your wings like an eagle  
Fly and touch the sun
